vim-scripts            http://github.com/vim-scripts


Mirrors all the code on http://www.vim.org/scripts/index.php to GitHub.

TODO: write up a github HTML site and link to it here.


This repository is pretty uninteresting since it only contains the scraper.
The fun stuff is in all the other repos in this account.
