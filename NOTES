Probably todo:
    if a dir only contains a /license|readme/i file, move the file to the root dir
        if the file is /^readme$/i then rename it to readme.orig

Possibly bad (probably doesn't matter):
    0067 - nqc.vim         -- just a lot of weird files
    0070 - pt.vim.gz       -- not sure pt.dict is in the right place
    0071 - dctl.vim.gz     -- not sure dctl.dict is in the right place
    0084 - gdbvim.tar.gz   -- plugin is in /gdbvim/gdbvim.vim, not /plugin
