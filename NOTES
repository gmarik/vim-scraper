Known bugs:

none


Possibly fix:

ColorSchemeMenuMaker.vba drops a .VimballRecord in the wrong dir.

790 has a funny thing where it's jumping back and forth between python and python3.0.
    it should have been two separate scripts.  not sure we can do anything about that.

Probably todo:
    if a dir only contains a /license|readme/i file, move the file to the root dir
    0023

Possibly bad (probably doesn't matter):
    0067 - nqc.vim         -- just a lot of weird files
    0070 - pt.vim.gz       -- not sure pt.dict is in the right place
    0071 - dctl.vim.gz     -- not sure dctl.dict is in the right place
    0084 - gdbvim.tar.gz   -- plugin is in /gdbvim/gdbvim.vim, not /plugin


To check for duplicate names:
    cd scripts; ls | sed 's/[0-9]* - \(.*\)\.json/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r -n | less
