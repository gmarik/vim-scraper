- make the name check case-insensitive

- make sure the repo with the same name on github that we want to push
  to is actually is the same script.  probably easiest to check the url.

- put the id in the description anyway, makes it easy to search?  probably the date too!

- when creating a script file, make sure a script with the same name
  doesn't already exist.  if it does, rename the one we're pulling.

- check status and die on failure every time we shell out
- make sure the foreign chars in 2194 come through

790 has a funny thing where it's jumping back and forth between python and python3.0.
    it should have been two separate scripts.

0990 0991 0992: all have the same name

2393: remove top-level dir named 'vimfiles'?

Probably todo:
    if a dir only contains a /license|readme/i file, move the file to the root dir
    0023, 0096


Possibly bad (probably doesn't matter):
    0067 - nqc.vim         -- just a lot of weird files
    0070 - pt.vim.gz       -- not sure pt.dict is in the right place
    0071 - dctl.vim.gz     -- not sure dctl.dict is in the right place
    0084 - gdbvim.tar.gz   -- plugin is in /gdbvim/gdbvim.vim, not /plugin


Definitely bad but definitely doesn't matter:
    0016: 0.2 tarfile is broken, doesn't include plugin.vim


ColorSchemeMenuMaker.vba drops a .VimballRecord in the wrong dir.

To check for duplicate names:
    cd scripts; ls | sed 's/[0-9]* - \(.*\)\.json/\1/' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r -n | less
